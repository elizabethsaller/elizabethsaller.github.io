			“Elizabeth is a joy to work and play with! Her attention to detail and her dedication to making the music have its own voice and story inspires me to work harder every time. She has an obvious and impressive amount of formal training under her belt, but still manages to stay humble and maintain a great attitude and hunger for learning new skills and perspectives toward music and performance. And most importantly, she has a great sense of humor that keeps things fun even when she's working hard.”

		“Elizabeth has been nothing but an inspiration to me over the years. I used to be very shy with my flute playing and she broadened my horizons by encouraging me to have confidence and be the best I can be. Thanks to her I learned piccolo and sharpened my piano skills. Without her I never would have become drum major of my marching band or have made it into Allstate.”

			“I’ve been a student of Ms. Elizabeth’s for about three years now, and during the course of those three years, she has completely changed my perspective on flute. When I first began lessons in the eighth grade, I figured that flute (and band) was no more than another chore to check off on my path towards constructing a “well-rounded” image for myself for the sake of future college applications, but once I started lessons, it became something more than that. Rather than just teaching the technicalities of flute playing, Elizabeth teaches her students to channel their energy and power into their music. She often reminds me that flute was not something to feel burdened by but instead something to find enjoyment and inspiration in. She even managed to transform the task of learning to sight read from something that I absolutely despised to the thing I looked forward to most during my lesson. The energy and passion she puts into her lessons always transfers over to both my mood and my flute playing; she’s a happyvirus, and it’s always such an enjoyment to walk in to her class. I’ve had many private teachers and tutors for music and artistic skills alike, but it is safe to say that she has always been one of my favorites.”

			“Taking flute lessons with Elizabeth for the last six years has been one of the best decisions I have made. Elizabeth has taught me everything I know about flute and music. Even more importantly, she is a wonderful person and has helped me improve my work ethic and acted as a mentor to me every step of the way.”

			“I began taking lessons with Elizabeth with very little piano experience, although I had experience as a flute player. Almost two years later, I can now say that I have not only grown as a piano player, but also as an overall musician. Elizabeth is truly dedicated to not only teaching the music, but also connecting with each of her students in a unique way. Elizabeth will make an effort to get to know you as a person, and is incredibly understanding. She truly cares about her students and about making sure that each one can accomplish their goals—whether it be simply learning how to play a scale, or even auditioning for the All-State Band. Although I wish I could have had Elizabeth for longer before leaving for college, I am incredibly lucky to have had her as a teacher even for a short amount of time. I can definitely say that choosing Elizabeth as my piano teacher was one of the best decisions I ever made.”

			“I started piano lessons when I was about 10 years old. My first teacher did not care and was mostly in it for the money. He was always cancelling lessons. My second piano teacher was very strict. She was all about the theory and no emotion. I only had her for a few lessons though, before I met Elizabeth. She is the perfect combination of strict and relaxed, and has progressed my learning further than any other teacher I’ve had. She is very funny and laid back, yet she also gives out homework and assignments. She always puts her students first and I think that’s an important quality. She will do whatever it takes to guarantee success for her students.”

			“Elizabeth Saller is a great teacher.  From my very first piano lesson with her I knew she was gonna be an excellent teacher.  She is patient and encouraging and I love her upbeat and positive attitude.  I find her teaching style to be fun and exciting which makes me look forward to class each week.  She's fun and a little crazy but we get along very well and I wouldn't want anyone else to teach me how to play piano.”
