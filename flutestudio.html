							<div class='studentDesc'>My name is Mason and I have been playing flute for four years. I have participated in many orchestras and one of them is the GMEA Honors Band and All-state. When I grow up I plan on being a professional flutist, I hope to attend Juliard University and major in Music. I have been first chair in my school ever since sixth grade and I have never lost a school wide competition. I enjoy performing and progressing in flute because I enjoy it and fell in love with it ever since I was little. I am currently fourteen in the year of 2012. I am a freshman attending school at Lanier High School. I have studied with professors including Elizabeth Saller, Erica Pirtle, and James Galway (for a short time).

							<div class='studentDesc'>I’m Tori and I’m 13 years old. I’m currently in seventh grade and I’m first chair flute in my band and I just started playing piccolo. For my connections I’m taking band and jazz band. I did solo and ensemble this year for my first time and got scores of excellence. I recently just tried out for Honor Band and All-State. I got into Honor Band and was also the only seventh grader in my district that was allowed to move on and try out for All-State. I’ve been playing flute for about a year and a half now. The reason I started playing flute is because I grew very fond of the instrument after watching my Mom play it several times and I thought is would be cool to follow in her footsteps and play too.

								I have always loved playing the flute, but I could not continue playing during high school. Now, I have picked up again thanks to Ms. Saller! I love science and plan on being an ophthalmologist. Currently, I play the flute for fun, but I hope to join a group where I can exhibit my talent! I love Chinese food, traveling, and learning new languages too!

							<div class='studentDesc'>My name is Grace Pfohl. I have been playing flute for six months. I enjoy playing music and the sound of the flute. I enjoy learning rhythms and writing songs. I have performed a solo in my Band Enrichment Showcase (I auditioned for this). In the future, I want to be able to read music better and be more fluent. Flute is not the only instrument I have played. I have played piano and recorder. I would eventually like to play other instruments like the piccolo and the guitar.

							<div class='studentDesc'>Hi my name is Christine and I just started playing flute. I am 10 years old. I go to State Bridge Crossing and I am in the 4th grade. I like the Flute because it makes high and pretty sounds. It's easy to play the notes but it is hard to play with a good sound. I want to work hard and become awesome at playing the flute.
