	<p>Elizabeth’s flute studio is located in Atlanta, Georgia.<br>
	   Registration is currently open to new students. You may email or call for available lesson times, rates, and with any questions.</p>
	<p>Elizabeth helps students attain self fulfillment through their individual musical journeys. Any student working in her studio finds all aspects of music to be at his or her fingertips. Enhancing one’s awareness of music theory, music history, and aural knowledge are Elizabeth’s primary goals for her students. Lessons are catered to each individual’s desire for how he or she wishes to grow musically. Students in her studio range from beginning elementary and middle school students, amateur adults, and University undergraduates majoring in music. Many former students have been accepted to Conservatories and University music schools, as well as honored with various music performance based scholarships.</p>
	<p>Besides private lessons, Elizabeth is an educational and entertaining masterclass and ensemble clinician. She has worked with elementary and middle school students in masterclasses and teaches sectionals at middle and high school music programs throughout the year. Feel free to contact Elizabeth about teaching sectionals and/or masterclasses at your school.</p>
